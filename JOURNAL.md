## 10/23/2025 4:44 PM - Log 1: deciding to build a keyboard because why not  

spent like 2 hours spiraling through mechanical keyboard rabbit holes on reddit.
people really out here using 40 key boards like it’s a game of tetris
me? i want a thicc board. full send. named it MegaBoard because it sounds strong. powerful.
opened KiCad. stared at the screen for 10 minutes like it had insulted my family.
finally made a rectangle. celebrated like i just discovered electricity.
progress is progress, even if it’s one rectangle. made the schematic in the next 2 hours

## 10/23/2025 4:47 PM - matrix moment  

okay so what even is a diode matrix.
spent 2 hours in the youtube trenches learning why keyboards don’t catch fire when multiple keys are pressed.
respect to every tutorial with crusty mic audio, you taught me more than my formal education ever did
laid out the switches in KiCad. looked cursed but in a fun way.
accidentally deleted half the traces. ctrl+z came in like a superhero.
genuinely felt like i was defusing a bomb.
