## 10/23/2025 - Log 1: deciding to build a keyboard because why not  

spent like 2 hours spiraling through mechanical keyboard rabbit holes on reddit.
people really out here using 40 key boards like it’s a game of tetris
me? i want a thicc board. full send. named it MegaBoard because it sounds strong. powerful.
opened KiCad. stared at the screen for 10 minutes like it had insulted my family.
finally made a rectangle. celebrated like i just discovered electricity.
progress is progress, even if it’s one rectangle. made the schematic in the next 2 hours
