## 10/23/2025 4:44 PM - Log 1: deciding to build a keyboard because why not  

spent like 2 hours spiraling through mechanical keyboard rabbit holes on reddit.
people really out here using 40 key boards like it‚Äôs a game of tetris
me? i want a thicc board. full send. named it MegaBoard because it sounds strong. powerful.
opened KiCad. stared at the screen for 10 minutes like it had insulted my family.
finally made a rectangle. celebrated like i just discovered electricity.
progress is progress, even if it‚Äôs one rectangle. made the schematic in the next 2 hours

## 10/23/2025 4:47 PM - matrix moment  

okay so what even is a diode matrix.
spent 2 hours in the youtube trenches learning why keyboards don‚Äôt catch fire when multiple keys are pressed.
respect to every tutorial with crusty mic audio, you taught me more than my formal education ever did
laid out the switches in KiCad. looked cursed but in a fun way.
accidentally deleted half the traces. ctrl+z came in like a superhero.
genuinely felt like i was defusing a bomb.

## 10/24/2025 - trace spaghetti simulator  

back to PCB layout
basically moved traces around for 2 hours like a 3D puzzle
every time i fixed one connection, three others broke.
it‚Äôs giving whack-a-mole energy
added labels like ‚ÄúR1‚Äù and ‚ÄúC3‚Äù everywhere to look like i knew what i was doing
it now looks legit. don‚Äôt ask me what anything does
confidence: high. competence: unconfirmed.

## 10/28/2025 1:19 AM - screw placements are a lie  

realized i had no actual mounting points
revisited the case design to add proper screw holes
spent 45 minutes trying to align four holes in Fusion 360
they still don‚Äôt line up. i gave up and used the ‚Äúclose enough‚Äù method
case now looks like it‚Äôs meant to survive an earthquake![screw](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjA1MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--be4ae270ea40295b86cf581901ff6b1d73d32381/screw.png)
  

## 10/28/2025 1:21 AM - case redesign chaos  

turns out my first case design was actual garbage.
like not even misaligned a little it fully didn‚Äôt fit the PCB.
someone looked at it and basically said ‚Äúbro what is this.‚Äù
top shell was too tight, mounting holes didn‚Äôt match, and the USB cutout? yeah it was aimed at the void.
i took the L and started from scratch. deleted most of the Fusion timeline out of spite
made a new case with actual clearance, fixed the standoff placements, realigned everything to the PCB
also added a fake flex grill just to feel something
lesson learned: don‚Äôt freestyle case design without double-checking PCB dimensions ![case des](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjA1NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9883b99e2d9f02f431279b58a474128f094e7f56/case%20des.png)
  

## 10/28/2025 1:22 AM - precision? never heard of her  

spent 3 hours playing tetris with standoffs.
moved one standoff 0.1mm and somehow the whole shell exploded.
spent 30 minutes yelling at the Fusion timeline and 2 hours fixing sketch constraints that i definitely did not break.
tried adding side vents looked like cheese grater holes so i gave up.
realized halfway in that i still hadn‚Äôt added clearance for keycaps.
also tried ‚Äúfilleting for vibes‚Äù which made everything worse.
progress? questionable. stress? yes.

## 10/29/2025 - clearance redemption arc  

finally sat down and measured keycap + switch + plate stack height like a responsible human being.
redesigned the top shell again to stop it from bullying the switches.
added the space bar key properly (centered it this time üíÄ), and made sure it didn‚Äôt point to Narnia.
got brave and tried snapping the case together in the render it actually fit.
the standoffs and holes now line up , and i didn‚Äôt break the timeline this time.
might even add labels to sketches like a real CAD adult.
3 hours in, confidence restored... for now.
